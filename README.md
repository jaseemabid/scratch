# Scratch

## What?

Scratch is a collection of several dummy projects in several languages I code
in, with common dependencies and libraries installed already.

## Why?

If you have to run a Haskell script with a lens dependency or a Python script
that rely on beautiful soup and request, how long will that take you? This
project does those steps for you. Having one place to do this eliminates setup
cost from second time onward, gives you boilerplate you can quickly copy over
and all those things.

Also because I needed this several times.

## The name?

Emacs gives you a _*scratch*_ buffer when it starts up for emacs-lisp. This is a
scratch buffer for all languages you care about.

## Dependency Versions?

Latest. Let's keep things simple.

## TODO

- [ ] Remove my name from everywhere. Config?
- [ ] Scripts to bootstrap language modules
